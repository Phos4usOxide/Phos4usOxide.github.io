        <h1>Web Usability</h1>
        <p>One of the most important requirements of a well-designed website is its usability. This includes funtional
            aspects such as ease of use and accessibility. Can the users navigate the page on their first visit, even
            with poor sight? Can users understand the text and images? Do the users know what they need to do? Are the
            functions and content provided by the site accessible to everyone? These are all questions that must be
            considered when designing a website with good usability. Remember, the website will create a lasting
            impression on the users, so aim for the best. Let's check out some information and guidelines for web
            usability!

                <h2>Why?</h2>
                <p>A website with good usability will be user-centered and focuses on the users' point of view. It
                    should allow all users to easily navigate the site, understand the contents, and use its
                    functionality, regardless of who they are and if they're a new or returning visitor. Good usability
                    will improve user satisfaction, increasing their personal time at the site and ultimately attracting
                    more vistors. Users are visiting the site for a goal so make sure they can easily do it.

                <h2>Ease of Use</h2>
                <p>Users don't want difficulty figuring out how to use every new site they visit, so make sure the site
                    has high familiarity and learnability. It should work they way the users expect it to, which means
                    following standards and seeing how other sites do the same things. Using the site should be
                    intuitive, which means minimal to zero instructions. A way to not have instructions is to naturally
                    guide the users through the site and through any actions being performed, so users aren't getting
                    lost or guessing. Users should also know the state of the page, including where they are in a
                    multi-step process, so they don't feel lost or confused.

                <h2>Simplicity</h2>
                <p>Keep the page simple and the content clear. Focus on what's important and relevant to the users and
                    remove any extraneous details. Ensure there is a good balance of content and whitespace. If there is
                    too much content or too many elements, the users can get overwhelmed, distracted, and confused.
                    Make sure everything is consistent throughout the page so users can gets used to it quickly.
                    Minimalist designs are very powerful, so I recommend checking out their designs. An example is
                    <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple's website</a> which contains only what's
                    needed and easy to follow along.

                <h2>Technical</h2>
                <p>Uptime is very important because if visitors cannot access the page or functionality isn't working,
                    they will leave. The content, mainly multimedia, must load quickly and correctly on any device and
                    aspect ratio. Ensure that all possible errors are noticed and delt with, but preventing them from
                    happening is the best approach. Lastly, ensure there are no broken links, meaning they all link to
                    where they're supposed to.
